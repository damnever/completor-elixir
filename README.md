## Elixir code completion

Based on [completor.vim](https://github.com/maralla/completor.vim).

NOTE: It is in Beta status, since this is my very first try on elixir-lang :)


### Install

Here, I am using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
```
Plug 'maralla/completor.vim'
Plug 'damnever/completor-elixir'
```

Resolve deps:
```
cd /path/to/plugin/completor-elixir
make
```
